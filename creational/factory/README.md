### 🏭 Factory Pattern

**What is it?** 🎨
The Factory pattern defines a common interface for creating an object with different behaviors.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It defines an interface for objects without knowing the exact implementation. This allows for the creation of various objects that share the same interface but have different implementations.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you want to delegate object creation to subclasses without worrying about the specific implementation. It's useful for centralizing a series of actions or common classes with slightly different logic.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Adheres to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility and Open/Closed).
- Promotes code reuse and centralization of common logic.
- Provides flexibility in object creation.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Can lead to a complex class hierarchy.
- Increases system complexity.

**Frequency of Use:** High

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Factory pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **high**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Simplicity and Effectiveness:** The Factory pattern is relatively simple to implement and provides a highly effective way to manage object creation.
2. **Common Use Cases:** It is widely used in scenarios where there is a need to create instances of objects that share a common interface but may have different implementations. This includes creating UI components, services, or objects that vary based on configuration.
3. **Support for SOLID Principles:** The pattern adheres to important SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility and Open/Closed, which promotes maintainable and scalable codebases.
