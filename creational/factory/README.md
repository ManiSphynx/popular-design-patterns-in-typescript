### 🏭 Factory Pattern

**What is it?** 🎨
The Factory pattern defines a common interface for creating an object with different behaviors.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It defines an interface for objects without knowing the exact implementation. This allows for the creation of various objects that share the same interface but have different implementations.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you want to delegate object creation to subclasses without worrying about the specific implementation. It's useful for centralizing a series of actions or common classes with slightly different logic.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Adheres to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility and Open/Closed).
- Promotes code reuse and centralization of common logic.
- Provides flexibility in object creation.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Can lead to a complex class hierarchy.
- Increases system complexity.
