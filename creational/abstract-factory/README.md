### 🏭 Abstract Factory Pattern

**What is it?** 🏗️
The Abstract Factory pattern defines an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete implementations. Essentially, it's a factory of factories.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It helps centralize multiple factories by providing a common contract, enabling the creation of various related objects.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you need to create more than one factory that will have subclasses or similar behaviors.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Provides a common interface.
- Ensures consistency in object creation.
- Isolates client code from the specifics of object creation.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Increases system complexity.
- Can be excessive for small systems.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Abstract Factory pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Moderate Complexity:** While the Abstract Factory pattern introduces some complexity, it is manageable and often justified in applications that require the creation of multiple related objects.
2. **Usefulness in Large Systems:** It is particularly useful in larger systems where there is a need to ensure consistency in object creation and to isolate client code from the specifics of object instantiation.
3. **Common Use Cases:** It is commonly used in scenarios involving GUI toolkits, cross-platform applications, and situations where the system needs to support multiple families of related objects.
