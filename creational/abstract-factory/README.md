### 🏭 Abstract Factory Pattern

**What is it?** 🏗️
The Abstract Factory pattern defines an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete implementations. Essentially, it's a factory of factories.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It helps centralize multiple factories by providing a common contract, enabling the creation of various related objects.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you need to create more than one factory that will have subclasses or similar behaviors.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Provides a common interface.
- Ensures consistency in object creation.
- Isolates client code from the specifics of object creation.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Increases system complexity.
- Can be excessive for small systems.
