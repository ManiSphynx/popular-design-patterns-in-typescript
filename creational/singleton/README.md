### 🔄 Singleton Pattern

**What is it?** 🎨
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is particularly useful in situations where it is necessary to coordinate actions across the system using a single object.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Singleton pattern is used to control access to shared resources, such as databases, configuration files, or centralized services. Its main purpose is to ensure that multiple instances of a class are not created and to provide controlled access to the single instance.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
- When you need exactly one instance of a class to control access to some shared resource.
- When you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to that instance.
- When you need a single point of control for the instance, such as a database connection or a centralized configuration manager.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Controlled access to a single instance:** Ensures that only one instance of the class exists.
- **Reduced namespace pollution:** Provides a single instance, avoiding multiple instances and reducing the risk of naming conflicts.
- **Global access point:** Provides a global access point to the instance, making it easy to access from anywhere in the application.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Global state:** Can introduce global state into an application, making it more difficult to manage and test.
- **Concurrency issues:** In multithreaded environments, care must be taken to handle concurrent access to the singleton instance.
- **Hidden dependencies:** Can hide dependencies, making the code less clear and harder to maintain.

**Frequency of Use:** High

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Singleton pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **high**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Control of Shared Resources:** The pattern is extremely useful for managing shared resources such as configurations, logging instances, or connections, which are common in many applications.
2. **Simplicity:** It is straightforward to implement and understand, making it a go-to solution for ensuring a single instance of a class.
3. **Global Access:** Provides a simple way to create a globally accessible instance, which is beneficial in many scenarios where a single point of access is needed.
