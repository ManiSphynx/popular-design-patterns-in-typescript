### 🧬 Prototype Pattern

**What is it?** 🎨
The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It helps in creating new instances of objects by cloning the existing objects, which is especially useful for objects that are costly to create from scratch.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when:
- The cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning an existing one.
- You need to create objects that are similar but not exact duplicates.
- You want to hide the complexities of creating new instances from the client.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the cost and time of creating new instances.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that cloned objects maintain the properties of the prototype.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for easy modification of prototypes and creation of new instances at runtime.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity in Deep Cloning:** Handling deep cloning (where objects contain other objects) can be complex.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Managing and maintaining prototypes can add overhead, especially in large systems.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium-Low

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Prototype pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium-low**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Cost of Cloning vs. Creating:** While cloning can be efficient, modern JavaScript engines make object creation relatively cheap, reducing the need for this pattern.
2. **Common Use Cases:** The pattern is useful in specific scenarios where object creation is costly or complex, but these cases are less common in typical web development projects.
3. **Complexity in Cloning:** Handling deep cloning can add complexity, making simpler patterns like Factory often more appealing for many use cases.
