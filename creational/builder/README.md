### 🏗️ Builder Pattern

**What is it?** 🛠️
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object so that the same construction process can create different representations.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It facilitates the construction of complex objects step by step using the same construction process.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when constructing a complex object with many parts and different representations of the same object, or when you want to separate the logic of object construction from the final object.

**How does it work?** ⚙️
The Builder pattern is composed of several key elements:
- **Builder:** Interface that defines methods for creating different parts of the object.
- **Concrete Builder:** Implementation of the Builder interface.
- **Product:** The complex object being constructed.
- **Director:** An optional class that directs the construction process.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Step-by-step creation of objects.
- Separates the construction process, allowing for different representations of the object.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Adds additional complexity to the system by requiring multiple classes (Builder, Concrete Builder, etc.).
