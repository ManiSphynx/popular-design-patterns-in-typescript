### 🌳 Composite Pattern

**What is it?** 🌳
The Composite pattern is a design pattern that allows you to perform operations on objects uniformly and organize these objects in a tree structure.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It serves to perform uniform operations on a series of related objects. For example, in the context of tasks and projects, both tasks and projects can have titles, be deleted, etc.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
It should be used when you detect that the classes have a closely related hierarchy.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Flexibility:** Facilitates the extension and modification of the system.
- **Reusability:** Allows components to be reused in different contexts.
- **Uniformity:** Allows all objects in the structure to be treated uniformly.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity:** Can add complexity to the system due to the hierarchical structure.
- **Management difficulty:** Can be harder to manage and debug a complex hierarchical structure.

A useful analogy is how relational databases handle data hierarchies. For example, in a database, you might have a `Projects` table and a `Tasks` table, where each task belongs to a project. Similar to how the Composite pattern organizes objects in a tree structure, relational databases organize data in related tables, allowing queries and manipulations that reflect these relationships.
