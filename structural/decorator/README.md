### 🎨 Decorator Pattern

**What is it?** 🎨
The Decorator pattern allows additional functionalities to be added to an object dynamically and in a reusable way without modifying its structure.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It serves to extend the functionality of an object in a reusable way. The same functionality can be extended to other objects if needed.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you know you will have functionalities that will be repeated among objects and you want to reuse them. It is also useful when you want to centralize functionalities in a single place to manage and export them easily, and even classify them.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- Provides an alternative to class inheritance, making it usable in both object-oriented and functional programming.
- Promotes code reuse and is easy to extend.
- Allows functionalities to be added or removed from objects at runtime.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- Can be difficult to debug or trace the source of issues due to the number of decorators applied.
- Increases code complexity with the creation of many small objects.
- Can be overkill for small projects where simplicity is preferred.
