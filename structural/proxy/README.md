### 🛡️ Proxy Pattern

**What is the Proxy design pattern?** 🛡️
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that exposes a class acting as an intermediary to access other classes. This pattern helps to avoid the unnecessary instantiation of other classes by controlling this process. There are several types of proxies, such as Virtual Proxy, Remote Proxy, Protection Proxy, and Smart Reference.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Proxy pattern is used to:
- Control access to a sensitive class.
- Keep track of who has accessed the class.
- Store previously instantiated values in memory, saving the creation of new instances.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
You should consider using the Proxy pattern when:
- You need to control access to an object.
- The real object is costly to initialize.
- You require additional functionality without modifying the real object.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Access control:** Provides an additional layer of control over object access.
- **Resource optimization:** Allows deferred object creation until it is actually needed (lazy loading).

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity:** Adds an additional layer of abstraction and can complicate the system design.
