### 🛡️ Proxy Pattern

**What is the Proxy design pattern?** 🛡️
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that exposes a class acting as an intermediary to access other classes. This pattern helps to avoid the unnecessary instantiation of other classes by controlling this process. There are several types of proxies, such as Virtual Proxy, Remote Proxy, Protection Proxy, and Smart Reference.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Proxy pattern is used to:
- Control access to a sensitive class.
- Keep track of who has accessed the class.
- Store previously instantiated values in memory, saving the creation of new instances.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
You should consider using the Proxy pattern when:
- You need to control access to an object.
- The real object is costly to initialize.
- You require additional functionality without modifying the real object.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Access control:** Provides an additional layer of control over object access.
- **Resource optimization:** Allows deferred object creation until it is actually needed (lazy loading).

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity:** Adds an additional layer of abstraction and can complicate the system design.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Proxy pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Access Control Needs:** The Proxy pattern is beneficial for scenarios requiring controlled access to objects, such as API requests, logging, and caching, which are common in many applications.
2. **Lazy Initialization:** It is useful for deferring the creation of resource-intensive objects until they are needed, optimizing resource usage.
3. **Moderate Complexity:** While it adds some complexity, this is often justified by the enhanced control and optimization benefits, making it a practical choice for various applications.
