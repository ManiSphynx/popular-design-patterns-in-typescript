### 🌉 Facade Pattern

**What is it?** 🌉
The Facade pattern allows you to interact with a set of related classes from a single point. It centralizes methods that interact with the client into a single class, making interaction easier and avoiding unnecessary instance creation. The Facade class contains and centralizes instances of the related classes as needed.

**Purpose:** 🎯
It serves to centralize and organize a set of related classes into one and abstract the concrete implementations from the client.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Use this pattern when you have a system with very complex interfaces and you want better structuring of the system and decoupling of the code.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between the client and the complex subsystem.
- **Encapsulation:** Hides the complexity of the subsystem and only exposes what is necessary.
- **Single Responsibility:** Provides a single interface for interaction.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Overhead:** Can add an unnecessary layer of code in simple systems.
- **Excessive Hiding:** May hide too much of the subsystem for advanced users who need to interact directly with the underlying interfaces.
