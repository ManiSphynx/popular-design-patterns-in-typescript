### 🪶 Flyweight Pattern

**What is it?** 🪶
The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects. This is achieved by storing objects that can be reused (intrinsic attributes) and creating an instance of them when needed instead of creating multiple instances of the same object. The main components include:

- **Type Class (Flyweight):** Contains intrinsic attributes that are common to multiple objects.
- **Factory Class (Flyweight Factory):** Manages the creation and storage of Flyweight objects. Ensures that existing instances are reused instead of creating new ones.
- **Context Class:** Contains the unique extrinsic attributes for each object instance.
- **Client:** Uses the Factory to obtain instances of the Type Class and combines these with extrinsic attributes to create complete objects.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Flyweight pattern is used to:
- Save runtime resources.
- Avoid unnecessary duplication of objects.
- Reduce memory usage.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Flyweight pattern when:
- You have a large number of nearly identical objects that can share most of their data.
- You need to optimize memory usage.
- The objects have parts that can be shared (intrinsic state) and parts that cannot be shared (extrinsic state).

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Memory Savings:** By sharing common data between objects.
- **Performance Improvement:** By reducing the creation of new objects, efficiency is improved.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **State Management:** Distinguishing and managing intrinsic and extrinsic states can be complicated.
- **Increased Complexity:** Implementing the Flyweight pattern adds complexity to the application design.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium-Low

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Flyweight pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium-low**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Specific Use Cases:** The pattern is most beneficial in scenarios with a large number of similar objects, which is not as common in many typical web development projects.
2. **Complexity:** Implementing and managing the Flyweight pattern can add significant complexity, especially when managing the intrinsic and extrinsic states of objects.
3. **Memory Optimization Needs:** While memory optimization is crucial in some applications, modern JavaScript engines handle memory efficiently, reducing the need for explicit Flyweight implementations in many cases.
