### 🔗 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

**What is it?** 🧩
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a client request to be evaluated by a chain of objects until one of these objects is able to process the request. Each object in the chain has the opportunity to handle the request or pass it to the next object in the chain. The main components include:

- **Handler:** Declares a common interface for handling requests and has a reference to the next handler in the chain.
- **ConcreteHandler:** Implements the logic to handle requests. If it can handle the request, it does; otherwise, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.
- **Client:** Initiates the request to one of the handlers in the chain.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is used to:
- Decouple the sender of a request from its final receiver.
- Allow multiple objects to handle a request.
- Pass a request along a chain of handlers until it is processed.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:
- You want to add flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- There are multiple objects that can handle a request, and the final handler is not predetermined.
- You want a request to pass through a chain of objects until one handles it.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Decoupling:** The sender of a request does not need to know the final receiver.
- **Reusability of code:** Handlers can be reused across different chains.
- **Organization of responsibilities:** Facilitates the organization and assignment of responsibilities among handler objects.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complex debugging:** It can be difficult to track requests through the chain.
- **Lack of handling guarantee:** There is no guarantee that the request will be handled if no handler can process it.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Chain of Responsibility pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Flexibility in Request Handling:** The pattern is useful for scenarios where requests need to be handled by multiple objects, providing flexibility in how responsibilities are assigned and managed.
2. **Moderate Complexity:** While it adds some complexity, it is often justified by the improved organization and decoupling of request handling logic.
3. **Common Use Cases:** It is commonly used in middleware processing, event handling, and command processing pipelines, which are prevalent in various applications.
