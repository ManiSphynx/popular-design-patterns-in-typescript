### 🏢 Visitor Pattern

**What is it?** 🏢
The Visitor pattern allows adding new operations to a structure of objects without modifying the classes of the elements on which it operates, his pattern uses a technique called "double dispatch" to call the correct operation dynamically based on both the visitor type and the element type being visited.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Visitor pattern is used to separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the classes of the elements, adheres to the open/closed principle, where classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Visitor pattern when:
- You need to perform many distinct and unrelated operations on a structure of objects.
- You want to avoid cluttering your object classes with multiple unrelated operations.
- You want to add new operations to a structure of objects without modifying their classes.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Flexibility:** Allows adding new operations without changing the classes of the elements.
- **Separation of concerns:** Keeps operations separate from the object structure, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Adheres to open/closed principle:** The element classes do not need to be modified to add new operations.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity:** Increases the complexity of the system by introducing new interfaces and classes.
- **Type exposure:** Requires element classes to expose their type, which can break encapsulation.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Visitor pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Operation flexibility:** The Visitor pattern is useful for performing multiple operations on a structure of objects without modifying their classes.
2. **Balancing complexity and flexibility:** While it introduces new interfaces and classes, it provides great flexibility in adding new operations.
3. **Application scenarios:** It is particularly useful in applications like document analysis tools, where different types of documents require various operations such as word count, text extraction, and format conversion.
