### 🎭 State Pattern

**What is it?** 🎭
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, the object will appear to change its class, this is achieved by encapsulating the possible states of the object into separate objects and having the main object delegate behavior to these state objects.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The State pattern is used to change the behavior of an object at runtime, keeping the code clean and modular.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the State pattern when:
- An object needs to change its behavior at runtime depending on its state.
- You want to avoid multiple conditionals (if-else or switch) that manage the states of the object.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Code clarity:** Eliminates complex conditionals that manage states.
- **Modularity:** Each state is handled in its own class, making maintenance and extension easier.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates adding new states without modifying the existing context code.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Increased memory usage:** Can increase memory usage due to the creation of multiple state objects.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the State pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Behavioral management:** The State pattern is useful for managing the behavior of objects based on their state, which is a common requirement in various applications.
2. **Balancing complexity and memory:** While it provides powerful state management capabilities, it can lead to higher memory usage and added implementation complexity.
3. **Application scenarios:** It is particularly useful in applications like vending machines or state-driven workflows where the behavior changes based on the state.
