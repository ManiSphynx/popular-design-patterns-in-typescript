### 📄 Template Method Pattern

**What is it?** 📄
The Template Method pattern defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to customize specific steps of the algorithm, it maintains the same input and output interface while modifying the implementation of the steps.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Template Method pattern is used to avoid code duplication by reusing the general structure of an algorithm in the base class and allowing subclasses to customize the specific steps, promotes the reuse of the algorithm structure and facilitates maintenance.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Template Method pattern when:
- You have several algorithms that share a similar general structure but differ in their internal logic.
- You want to avoid duplicating common code across multiple subclasses.
- You want the structure of the algorithm to remain constant while allowing subclasses to customize certain steps.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Code reuse:** Allows reusing the general structure of the algorithm in the base class.
- **Code clarity:** Makes the code clearer by separating the algorithm structure from the specific steps.
- **Ease of maintenance:** Facilitates code maintenance by centralizing the algorithm structure and allowing changes in specific steps without affecting the overall structure.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Rigidity:** Can make subclasses overly dependent on the base class.
- **Additional complexity:** Introduces an additional dependency between the base class and subclasses.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Template Method pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Algorithm structure reuse:** The Template Method pattern is useful for reusing the structure of algorithms while allowing customization of specific steps, which is a common requirement in various applications.
2. **Balancing reuse and dependency:** While it promotes code reuse, it can also introduce rigidity due to dependency on the base class.
3. **Application scenarios:** It is particularly useful in scenarios like document processing systems, where different types of documents follow a similar processing structure but have specific steps that vary.
