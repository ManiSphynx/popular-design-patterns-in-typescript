### 🛠️ Strategy Pattern

**What is it?** 🛠️
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, it allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it instead of implementing a specific functionality directly, a common interface is defined for all algorithms, and each specific algorithm implements this interface, the context uses this interface to delegate behavior to one of the concrete implementations.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Strategy pattern is used to group a series of algorithms into a single point of access in a uniform manner, promoting the SOLID principle of open/closed (Open/Closed Principle), where a class is open for extension but closed for modification, additionally, it allows for dynamic switching of strategies at runtime.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Strategy pattern when:
- You have multiple ways to perform an operation and want to switch dynamically between them.
- You want to avoid multiple conditionals (if-else or switch) that select different variants of an algorithm.
- You want to encapsulate related algorithms within a family of classes.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Interchangeability:** Facilitates changing algorithms or strategies at runtime.
- **Code clarity:** Eliminates multiple conditionals that select algorithms.
- **Code reuse:** Each strategy is a separate class, facilitating its reuse in different contexts.
- **Ease of adding new strategies:** Makes it easy to add new strategies without modifying the existing context code.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Increased complexity:** Increases the number of classes and objects in the system.
- **Communication overhead:** Can introduce additional overhead due to communication between objects.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Strategy pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Algorithm management:** The Strategy pattern is useful for managing multiple algorithms and switching between them dynamically.
2. **Balancing complexity and flexibility:** While it increases the number of classes and communication overhead, it provides great flexibility and code reuse.
3. **Application scenarios:** It is particularly useful in applications like payment processing systems, where different payment methods can be encapsulated as strategies.
