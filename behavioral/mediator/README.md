### 🗂️ Mediator Pattern

**What is it?** 🗂️
The Mediator pattern encapsulates how objects interact, acting as an intermediary class that manages communication between concrete implementations, it prevents direct references between objects, allowing the mediator to handle interaction in an orderly and centralized manner.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Mediator pattern is used to centralize complex communication between objects and simplify it through an intermediary class, it promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to modify interactions without directly affecting the objects.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Mediator pattern when:
- You have a set of objects that communicate in complex ways, making the code difficult to maintain.
- You need to control how and when certain objects interact, especially in systems with multiple components interacting in various ways.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Simplified interaction:** Simplifies interaction between objects by centralizing communication.
- **Better maintainability:** Facilitates modifying interactions between objects by changing only the mediator instead of multiple objects.
- **Flexibility:** Makes it easy to add new interactions or change existing ones without modifying the objects directly.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Mediator overload:** The mediator can become complex and difficult to maintain if it handles too much logic.
- **Single point of failure:** If the mediator fails, all communication between objects is interrupted.

**Frequency of Use:** Medium

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Mediator pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **medium**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Centralized control logic:** The Mediator pattern is useful for centralizing complex communication and control logic, which can be beneficial in various applications.
2. **Balancing complexity:** While it reduces the complexity of direct interactions between objects, it can increase the complexity of the mediator itself.
3. **Application scenarios:** It is particularly useful in scenarios like UI components, where multiple components need to interact in complex ways.
