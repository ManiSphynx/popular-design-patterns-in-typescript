### 📜 Interpreter Pattern

**What is it?** 📜
The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate or interpret sentences in a language, this pattern defines a representation for the grammar of a language and uses this representation to interpret sentences in that language, the main components include:

- **AbstractExpression:** Declares an `interpret` method that is common to all classes representing grammar rules.
- **TerminalExpression:** Implements the `interpret` method for terminal symbols in the grammar.
- **NonTerminalExpression:** Implements the `interpret` method for non-terminal symbols in the grammar.
- **Context:** Contains global information used during interpretation.

**Purpose:** 🎯
The Interpreter pattern is used to:
- Add additional functionalities based on a specific grammar and context.
- Define and evaluate grammars and domain-specific languages (DSL).
- Parse and execute user-defined commands or sentences.
- Facilitate the implementation of rule engines and scripting languages.

**When to use it?** 🕰️
Consider using the Interpreter pattern when:
- You want to add functionalities that the base language does not provide.
- You have a simple language with a defined grammar that needs to be interpreted.
- You are building a system that needs to evaluate and execute dynamic rules or sentences.

**Benefits:** 🌟
- **Language Extension:** Allows you to define new functionalities and extend the capabilities of the language.
- **Flexibility:** Makes it easier to interpret and evaluate dynamic expressions.
- **Code Reusability:** Allows grammar definitions to be reused to evaluate multiple sentences.

**Drawbacks:** ⚠️
- **Complexity:** Can be complex to handle complicated grammars.
- **Performance:** May be slow due to the need to repeatedly interpret expressions.
- **Maintenance:** Maintaining the grammar and interpreter can be costly in large systems.

**Frequency of Use:** Low

**Reason:**
The frequency of use for the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript is **low**. This is due to several factors:

1. **Specific Use Cases:** The pattern is most beneficial in scenarios with a well-defined grammar and specific language needs, which are less common in typical web development projects.
2. **Complexity:** Implementing and managing the Interpreter pattern can add significant complexity, especially when handling intricate grammars.
3. **Alternative Solutions:** Many tasks that could benefit from the Interpreter pattern can often be solved with simpler and more direct methods in JavaScript and TypeScript.
